# leadership_evolution_model
The main branch contains the code I previously shared.
I will upload the restructured code to the 'two_gene' branch.
You can copy the code by 'forking' it. One feature of GitHub is that you can stay synchronized by using Git to clone the repository.
Once you sign up for an account, I can add you as a collaborator. This will allow you to control this repository as if you were me.
